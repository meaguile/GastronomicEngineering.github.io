    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      The Gastronomic Engineering laboratory is located in the Department of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Engineering of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Gastronomic engineering takes place in a unique space of co-creation where chefs and food engineers engage in the conception of tasty and healthy food structures. While chefs are creative and credible, food engineers provide the insights into the science behind foods and a methodology to characterize them. Most desirable characteristics of foods including sensorial and nutritional properties are related to the type of matrix which is formed by nature and transformed during cooking. Our final goals are to provide innovative cooking alternatives for our raw materials that promote pleasure and wellbeing, exciting learning processes and experiences for students, and to disclose the fascinating engineering inside our foods.
